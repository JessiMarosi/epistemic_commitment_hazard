# Epistemic Commitment Hazard

## Abstract
This repository formally defines a previously unnamed class of institutional hazard arising from irreversible epistemic state transitions at the point of decision commitment. Unlike operational, compliance, or cybersecurity risk, this hazard does not result from error, violation, or system failure, but from loss of institutional knowledge that becomes unrecoverable once decisions harden into implementation.

## Axiomatic Definition
Institutions operate in epistemic states composed of known facts, assumptions treated as true, alternatives considered, and the rationale connecting these elements to adopted decisions. When a decision transitions from deliberation to operational commitment, epistemic decay occurs: assumptions are forgotten, alternatives disappear, and rationale fragments across time, systems, and personnel. Beyond a threshold, this epistemic state cannot be reconstructed from system behavior, documentation, or outcomes, even in compliant, well-functioning institutions.

## Ontological Classification
This condition is classified as a hazard rather than a risk or failure. It is latent, non-probabilistic, and may never manifest as harm, yet constrains future auditability, accountability, and institutional adaptability under stress. The absence of immediate failure does not negate its presence.

## Non-Overlap Proof (Summary)
This hazard is irreducible to existing institutional risk classes:
- It is not cybersecurity risk, as no compromise or unauthorized action is required.
- It is not operational risk, as systems may function exactly as intended.
- It is not governance or compliance risk, as decisions may be fully approved and compliant.
- It is not human factors risk, as it occurs absent error, bias, or negligence.
- It is not documentation failure, as records may exist yet fail to preserve epistemic context.

Accordingly, this hazard constitutes a distinct failure dimension not owned by existing taxonomies.

## Mitigation (Without Class Collapse)
Epistemic Commitment Hazards are mitigated only by preserving institutional epistemic state at the moment of irreversible commitment, independent of enforcement, attribution, decision quality evaluation, or outcome prediction. Retroactive analysis does not constitute mitigation.

## Scope and Claim
This work does not claim novelty of phenomenon, but formal isolation of a failure dimension that existing frameworks structurally ignore. It does not propose a tool, product, or governance process, but establishes an ontological category necessary for institutional accountability and long-term resilience.
